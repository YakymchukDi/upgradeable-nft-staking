A demo project showcasing upgradeable NFTs with staking and rewards on Ethereum-compatible blockchains.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This smart contract allows users to:

- **Mint NFTs** with an initial level of 1 by paying a mint fee.  
- **Upgrade NFTs** by paying an upgrade fee to increase their level.  
- **Stake NFTs** to earn ETH rewards based on staking duration.  
- **Unstake NFTs** to receive earned rewards.  
- **Contract owner** can withdraw accumulated funds.

## üí° How It Works

1. **Mint NFT**: Call `mint()` with 0.05 ETH to receive a new NFT at level 1.  
2. **Upgrade NFT**: Call `upgrade(tokenId)` with 0.01 ETH to increase the NFT‚Äôs level.  
3. **Stake NFT**: Call `stake(tokenId)` to start earning rewards.  
4. **Unstake NFT**: Call `unstake(tokenId)` to stop staking and get rewards based on staking time.  
5. **Withdraw funds**: Owner calls `withdraw()` to transfer all collected ETH to their wallet.
